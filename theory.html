            <h2 class="th-intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that a sum of money is worth more now than
                the same sum will be at a future date due to its earnings potential in the interim.</p>
            <p> This is a core principle of finance. A sum of money in the hand has greater value than the
                same sum to be paid in the future.</p>
            <p>The time value of money is also referred to as present discounted value.</p>
            <h2 class="th-head2">KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
            <p>Time value of money means that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum of money in the
                future.<br>
                This is because money can grow only through investing. An investment delayed is an opportunity lost.<br>
                The formula for computing the time value of money considers the amount of money, its future value, the
                amount it can earn, and the time frame.<br>
                For savings accounts, the number of compounding periods is an important determinant as well.</p>

            <h2 class="th-head2">FORMULA FOR TIME VALUE OF MONEY</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the exact situation, the formula for the time value of money may change slightly. For
                example,
                in
                the case of annuity or perpetuity payments, the generalized formula has additional or fewer factors. But
                in
                general, the most fundamental TVM formula takes into account the following variables:<br>
                FV = Future value of money<br>
                PV = Present value of money<br>
                i = interest rate<br>
                n = number of compounding periods per year<br>
                t = number of years<br><br>
                Based on these variables, the formula for TVM is:<br>
